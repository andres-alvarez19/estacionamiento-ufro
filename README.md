## üì± Project

The **UFRO Parking** project is a UXD initiative focused on creating a user-friendly application to manage the use and reservation of parking spaces at the Universidad de La Frontera (UFRO). It aims to address the needs of different user types, including students, faculty, staff, and visitors, providing them with real-time availability, reservations, and parking history.

## üìå Problem

At UFRO, users currently face difficulties when attempting to park on campus due to a lack of organization, real-time information, and transparent access to parking services. These issues lead to:

- Time wasted searching for available spots.
- Unclear parking policies and inconsistent reservation procedures.
- No visibility over parking history or usage statistics.

## üéØ Objectives

- Design a responsive and accessible mobile-first interface for all user types.
- Improve parking availability transparency.
- Allow reservations and manage user-vehicle data effectively.
- Provide administrative tools for analytics and space management.

## Heuristics & Accesibility
Unfortunately, the heuristic could not be incorporated because our counterpart did not provide the required information.

## Reasoning for changes

The changes implemented from version 1 to the final release were made based on the feedback received during the initial presentation. Key modifications include:
- Removal of the role selector on the login screen.
- Omission of the area selection option when making a reservation.
- Addition of a summary displaying the estimated cost of the reservation.
In addition to these improvements, the remaining screens were finalized to ensure full navigability of the application.
