## 📱 Project

The **UFRO Parking** project is a UXD initiative focused on creating a user-friendly application to manage the use and reservation of parking spaces at the Universidad de La Frontera (UFRO). It aims to address the needs of different user types, including students, faculty, staff, and visitors, providing them with real-time availability, reservations, and parking history.

## 📌 Problem

At UFRO, users currently face difficulties when attempting to park on campus due to a lack of organization, real-time information, and transparent access to parking services. These issues lead to:

- Time wasted searching for available spots.
- Unclear parking policies and inconsistent reservation procedures.
- No visibility over parking history or usage statistics.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Design a responsive and accessible mobile-first interface for all user types.
- Improve parking availability transparency.
- Allow reservations and manage user-vehicle data effectively.
- Provide administrative tools for analytics and space management.
